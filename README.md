# CarRentalSystem-using-Java-oops

- 4 basic pillars of oops implemented in this simple project

### workflow of this project :

- customer comes to the car rental service to rent a car
- system displays all the cars currently available for booking
- customer enters the carId and no of days for the rent
- system calculates total bill and genrates a report
- customer can cancel or confirm the bill
- car is gone for rent - then customer comes back to return the car and using the carId he/she returns the car

## future work

- adding rent date and time
- if returned after the original return date then apply fine
- add more functionlity
- generating a GUI(graphical user interface for interactive communication)
